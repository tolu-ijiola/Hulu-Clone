# Hulu Website Clone

I created a hulu clone website for my portfolio on github. I used the same design and layout as the original hulu website. I created this clone to showcase my skills in web development and to show potential employers that I am capable of building complex websites. This clone is an exact replica of the hulu website, except it is hosted on my own server and can be accessed through my github repository.
